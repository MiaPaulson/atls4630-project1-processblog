Here is our mid-fidelity prototype of what we want our final product to look like!

Data we need/keeping track of:
1. User input
2. Drink info from API (currently viewable from filters)
3. Cart
4. Favorites


## First Milestone
My job for the first milestone was to work on the Search and Filter section that's "static". I cross-referenced the others' code for my css ideas and little refreshers on react since I'm still super new to it.

I also used ChatGPT to help with specific CSS coding - I don't know every specific syntax, so I asked for some help with what I was envisioning.

Doing the research for a "dropdown" for sections to specify what the user is looking up in the search bar was a bit confusing. It looks like I'm going to have to make a new branch of the search and filter for the dropdown specifically, like how our cart is set up. So I made a new folder and file inside the SearchFilter section as a new branch.

Actually, after coding it, decided to NOT make Dropdown its own page. Just threw it in on the SearchFilter page.

I think I did it all right?? This is just the first milestone so that's good, but I'm just hoping I'm understanding what to do correclty. Since I was the last one able to work on it, below is what the static page looks like once I'm done:

Per usual with this code stuff, this part of the assignment (which is the easiest section, compared to the ones my partners did) took me a very long time. But, I'm practicing and getting better!
